# dotfiles

This repo contains my dotfile configuration that I use across multiple machines. I mainly use it on GNU/Linux (Ubuntu distribution) and MacOS.

I manage the various configuration files in this repo using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). This allows me to set up symlinks for all of my dotfiles using a single command:
```bash
stow .
```
